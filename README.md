### Tecnologies Used in this project

React, Styled Components, Data Table Component, React Icons

### Missed points

1. Missing retired/unretired behaviour
2. A better approach handling errors
3. Unit tests
4. No TypeScript

---

1 - I was not familiar with json-server so I could not figure out how to do a POST or PUT call to API in order to toggle between retired/unretired.

2 - I haven't touched a single line of React code since end of 2020 so I'm a little rusty and I failed in some approaches to keep app running even if backend returns some error.

3 - I have a shallow experience about unit tests. I have never worked with it before and this is a downside that I want to improve.

4 - Same as 3.

### Approaches

I've tried used all the common approaches such like using context API, work with theming, functional componentes, etc.

#### Considerations

Even with a possible negative feedback I want to say that I've enjoyed a lot work on this test. Working with react is quite a pleasure for me and I haven't worked with that for a while.
